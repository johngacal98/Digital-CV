## WORK EXPERIENCE
**Henkel - Supply Chain Intern** _2019_
 - Provided support for day-to-day transactions for the Quality Management Team (QMT) on the Certificate of Analysis (COA). Contributed in ensuring that the SLAs and KPIs are met consistently to achieve high customer satisfaction for the team. Monthly completed transactions averaging higher than, if not equal to, my team membersâ€™ number of completed transactions. Delivered a short presentation on how the QMT operates daily to a Regional Manager of Henkel.

**Entrego - Data Science Consultant** _2021_
 - A 4-month capstone project for my Master of Science in Data Science Degree at the Asian Institute of Management where we pitched a solution to Entrego for their data science problem. Entrego is a logistics company that focuses on last-mile deliveries and other logistics needs. I worked with a team that cleaned the company's client address data that provided better coordinates estimation of these addresses. The team also built a reinforcement learning model (Deep Q Network) to optimize the delivery routes of the riders of Entrego. The results of the project could potentially save thousands of pesos (Php) for the company on a daily basis.

**AIA Digital+ - Data Science Specialist** _2022_
- Create analytics models to help AIA business units solve business problems.
  - Stock Portfolio Optimization (project)
      - Index Tracking use case
      - Created a mathematical model (Linear Optimization Model) that suggests trades to execute by AIA fund managers.
      - Cost Savings and trade accuracy
      
  - Marketing (staff augmentation)
      - Automate Processes using Python that improve turnaround time of deliverables by the team.
      - Create analytics reports and analysis that provide insights to help campaign decision making
      - utilize existing propensity models (Next Best Offer) to supplement campaign efforts and prioritize leads for cross-sell and upsell activities
      - Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning Models)
